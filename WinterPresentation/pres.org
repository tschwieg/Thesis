* Thesis
** Topic
- Many video games have chosen to sell cosmetic alterations to their
  games using randomization mechanisms called ``loot boxes''
- Economic Literature tells us that there is no benefit to
  randomization for risk-neutral consumers, so the benefit must come
  from risk-loving consumers.
- How much more revenue-generating is this compared to traditional
  selling mechanisms?

* Counter-Strike
** What is Counter Strike?
- Popular First-Person Shooter video game first created in 1999,
  current version has existed since 2012
- Weapon Skins are items that change how your weapon looks within the game
- Skins can be opened from boxes for \(\$2.50\) or bought and sold at
  a secondary market
- The contents are each box are public, as are the probabilities of
  obtaining each of the contents.
- The boxes or their contents are able to be sold at a
  secondary market where Valve then takes 15% as a tax.

** Why do we care?
- We are interested in discovering what drives this market to feature
  randomization mechanisms.
- Are consumers inherently more risk-loving when they play video
  games?
- Is this driven by consumers over-weighting tiny probabilities as
  cumulative prospect theory suggests?
- Are consumers weighing benefits and losses differently?
- What is the magnitude of these gains from randomization?

** What do the weapon skins look like?

* Data
** The Data
- Contains complete market history for all items sold in the Steam
  Community Market for /Counter-Strike: Global Offensive/
- Market history is specific to the hour for the last 30 days,
  specific to the day for the remaining time the item has existed.
- Contains all active buy and sell orders for each of these items as
  of June 7^th 2018.
- Note that this not the only way to obtain the item, as it can also
  be obtained by opening the box. 



* Model
** Roadmap
- Want to estimate the demand of the consumers for each of the
  weapons contained in the game. 
- Compute the distribution of the risk-neutral price that consumers
  would be willing to pay for a loot-box.
- Compute the risk-preference of consumers by using the demand for the
  loot boxes and the demand for the contents.
- Calculate the benefit of randomization by the difference between the
  valuation distribution for the boxes, and the risk-neutral distribution.

** Discrete Choice
- There are many weapons available in the game, but discrete choice
  requires that we only ever buy a single item.
- Assume that there are distinct markets for each weapon ``role'' that
  is decided by domain knowledge.
- For example, a person would only consider buying a single AK47 skin,
  as he only ever have one equipped at a time.
- This assumes that no substitution occurs between weapon roles
  (AK47 never substituted for M4)

** Agents
- Want to use the Random Coefficients Logit Demand Model. (BLP 1995)

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation*}
  u_{ij} = \alpha_i p_j + \bm{x}_j' \bm{\beta}_i + \xi_j + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation*}
#+END_EXPORT
- $\alpha_i, \beta_i$ individual specific parameters, $x_j$ is the observed
  characteristics of good $j$, $\xi_j$ is unobserved characteristics (but
  the consumers and producers observe them). 
- $\epsilon_{ij}$ is distributed type 1 extreme value distribution with mean $0$.
- Logit demand with heterogeneity between consumers

** BLP Continued
- Consumer i's demand for good $j$ is given by:

\begin{equation*}
  \Pr( i \rightarrow j ) = \frac{\exp( \alpha_i p_j + x_j' \beta_i + \xi_j)}{\sum_{k \in
      \mathcal{F}_t} \exp( \alpha_i p_k + x_k' \beta_i + \xi_k)}
\end{equation*}

- Equilibrium Market share $\pi_j$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
  \hat{s}_j \approx \pi_j = \exV{ \Pr( i \rightarrow j )}
\end{equation*}

# ** BLP Estimation
# - Setting observed market shares equal to equilibrium market shares:
# \begin{equation*}
#   \hat{s}_j \approx \exV{ \Pr( i \rightarrow j )} = \int \Pr( i \rightarrow j) d\theta \approx \frac{1}{N_s}
#   \sum_{i=1}^{N_s} \Pr( i \rightarrow j)
# \end{equation*}

# - This can be inverted to solve for $\xi_j$ which are the unobserved
#   characteristics. To control for their endogeneity, we need instruments.

** Instruments
- Need instruments for both price and market share
- Price Instruments: The price of other contents in the same loot
  box. By our separate market assumption, this is exogenous. 
- Instrument relevance: Supply shocks (changes to the amount of boxes
  being opened) must affect the other contents as well as this one.
- Market Share instruments: BLP Instruments
- Use the sum of the characteristics of the other products in the
  market.

# ** MPEC Estimation
# - Estimate model using Generalized Method of Moments with the
#   condition: $\mathbb{E}[ \xi_j z_j ] = 0$.

# \begin{align*}
#   &\min_{\bm{\xi}_{j,t}, \xi_{j,t}} \bm{\xi}_{j,t}' \Omega \bm{\xi}_{j,t}\\
#     \text{subject to: } &s_{j,t} = \frac{1}{N_s} \sum_{i=1}^{N_s}
#                           \frac{\exp(\alpha_i p_j + x_j'\beta_i + \xi_j)}{\sum_{k\in
#                           \mathcal{F}_t} \exp( \alpha_i p_k + x_k'\beta_i +
#                           \xi_k)}\\
#   &\bm{\xi}_{j,t} = \xi_{j,t} \bm{z}_{j,t}  
# \end{align*}

** Risk Preferences
- Assume that consumers are homogeneous about risk-preferences and the
  market for the loot boxes and their contents are in equilibrium.
- This assumption implies that there are no differences between the
  consumers that purchase the loot boxes and those that do not.
- This allows our estimates of demand from the secondary market to be
  applied to the loot boxes.

** Risk Neutral Pricing
- From the distribution of valuations for the weapon skins, the
  risk-neutral valuations of the loot box are a convex combination. 
- By assuming normality on the valuations, this is computationally
  tractable.
- This risk-neutral pricing is the value that could be made by selling
  these items using traditional price-discovery mechanisms.

** Risk Estimation
- Want to estimate the risk primitives (Cumulative Prospect Theory)
- However market price is censored data of valuations. 
- Existing buy orders however are valuations. Reporting your actual
  valuation is a dominant strategy when you pay the seller's ask.
- Can estimate the risk-primitives using some functional form and
  Censored Maximum Likelihood Estimation

** Results
- Once we have computed the risk primitives, we can compute the
  benefit of randomization
- For some good $j$ with consumer $i$'s valuation $V_{ij}$, Let $F(V_i)$
  be the risk-transformed valuation.
- Benefit to Valve for this randomization is given by:
\begin{equation*}
\Pi = \int \sum \left[ F(V_{ij}) - V_{ij} \right] d\theta
\end{equation*}
