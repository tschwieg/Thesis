The question of the optimal mechanism for a monopolist selling
multiple differentiated but related products is a very complicated
question. In this paper I hope to shed light on a question of whether
a class of behavioral models, cumulative prospect theory, is helpful
in considering mechanisms that utilize randomness. I use field data
from a collection of markets for lotteries as well as secondary
markets for each of their contents to determine valuations, and build
a model of risk preferences from this. I seek to answer the question
of whether or not this model provides additional predictive and
explanatory power in examining behavior of individuals buying
lotteries. I aim to analyze which components of this model of behavior
are most important in these lotteries being valued so much above their
expected value. 

In essence, I have a field experiment and wish to determine from this
data whether or not cumulative prospect theory can explain
individual's behavior better than traditional "rational" models of
consumer behavior. This is an ideal setting for such a project as
these lotteries combine many elements that behavioral economists would
term "irrational". These lotteries feature many high value but
extremely low (order of $10^{-5}^{}$) probability outcomes, the potential
market is mainly teenagers, and the cost of participation is low
(\$2.50-4.00). In such a setting, one would expect a large gain from
predictive power employing a behavioral model of risk. 



There is relatively little literature in field and Industrial
Organization applying cumulative prospect theory, and I aim to show
that  

Exclusivity

One often-made assumption for tractibility is that consumers draw an
iid valuation from some distribution

We take the extreme on our assumption of the valuation, and assume
that there is a common-value to all consumers of the item. However the
common value is not static, as valuations are driven by unobserved
factors such as "coolness" and relative scarcity of the item in the
market. These two elements are changing over time, so the demand for
the item shifts, but the price that the item is being sold reflects
the valuation for that item at the current time period. 

Dynamics

Each of the contents of the box do not have any intrinsic value in a
non-economic sense. They are purely cosmetic alterations, and thus
are affected on a large magnitude by other consumer's choices and
preferences as well as their consideration set and other alternatives
that cannot be estimated. Their demand is also driven by the
equilibrium strategy within the game, that is non-stable. All of these
lead to problems in estimation of valuations over time. To reduce
the error arising from these dynamic problems in a static-demand
estimation problem, I intend to use data from a relatively small time
period where all factors are constant. 

In each time period, since a continuous double auction is converging
quickly to a competitive equilibrium, I assume equilibrium. However
the equilibrium is extremely strong in the sense that I do not allow
for strategies where individuals retain their lotteries without
opening. Markets are assumed to be efficient, and individuals
homogeneous, so no individual can not have information about a price
change that is not reflected in the market. 

This in essence rules out cases of market manipulation occurring, and
within a single good I found evidence of the price being artificially
raised in the time period studied, while other variants of it remained
constant. This item was removed from study in order to avoid
complications that can arise from this sort of dynamic behavior.
